[Bunker Interior]

## The chance that the bunker tileset will be chosen. The higher the value, the higher the chance. By default, the bunker will appear on valid moons with a roughly one in two chance.
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 150
# Acceptable value range: From 0 to 99999
BunkerRarity = 150

## Use 'list' to specify a custom list of moons for the bunker to appear on. Individual moons can be added to the list by editing the BunkerDungeonMoonsList config entry.
# Setting type: String
# Default value: list
# Acceptable values: list
BunkerMoons = list

## Note: Requires 'BunkerMoons' to be set to 'list'. 
## Can be used to specify a list of moons with individual rarities for moons to spawn on. 
## Rarity values will override the default rarity value provided in Bunker Rarity and will override BunkerGuaranteed. To guarantee dungeon spawning on a moon, assign arbitrarily high rarity value (e.g.  99999). 
## Moons and rarities should be provided as a comma-separated list in the following format: 'Name:Rarity' Example: March:150,Offense:150 
## Note: Moon names are checked by string matching, i.e. the moon name 'dine' would enable spawning on 'dine', 'diner' and 'undine'. Be careful with modded moon names.
# Setting type: String
# Default value: March,Offense
BunkerDungeonMoonsList = March,Offense

## If enabled, the bunker will be effectively guaranteed to spawn. Only recommended for debugging/sightseeing purposes.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
BunkerGuaranteed = false

[Bunker Length]

## if not -1, Overrides the Bunker length to what you set. 1 = 1 times big. 2 = twice as big. and so and so forth 
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: -1
BunkerLengthOverride = -1

[Outpost 31]

## Rarity at which the bunker appears on Outpost31. Lower this value to decrease the frequency of bunkers spawning on this moon. To ensure that the bunker spawns on Outpost31, do not set a value lower than  99999.
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 99999
Outpost31Rarity = 99999
