Adds a compass, useful for remembering where to go.

You notice how your neck ingame just doesn't go far enough down? This fixes that.

#### [ObjectVolumeController](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FlipMods/ObjectVolumeController/)

Boombox go brrr. But also can be loud. This lets your change the volume of various noise producing objects.

#### [ShipClock](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ATK/ShipClock/)

Why Zeekers decided the clock needs to go poof when you're in the ship I'll never understand. This solves that problem.

#### [GlowSteps](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Ozone/Glow_Steps/)

Adds glowing footprints for yourself and your teammates. Some consider it cheating. At default settings the footprints don't last for long and help you stalk your friends and scare them. Sorry, find them to help them.
