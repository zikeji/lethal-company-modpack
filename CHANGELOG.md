# 1.17.1

A quick patch instead of a minor version update due to the proximity.

### Additions

#### ReservedSlotCore/Walkie/Flashlight

Giving these mods another chance for.. reasons?

#### [BetterItemScan](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/PopleZoo/BetterItemScan/)

To replace ShipLoot, which hasn't been updated in a hot minute.

#### [PushCompany](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Midge/PushCompany/)

Violence is the answer.

#### [HornMoan](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/MetalPipeSFX/HornMoan/)

Nice. For a drunk night.

#### [DynamicDeadline](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Krayken/DynamicDeadline/)

Instead of the rolling quota let's try an increasing deadline.

#### [Backrooms](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Backrooms/Backrooms/)

Let's add some flavor.

### Removals

#### QuotaRollover

Unfortunately the mod allows your overtime bonus to be calculated based on the overrage, which is broken. It would ideally modify the overtime calculation to not take into account the overrage. The author has no contact info so there is no way to suggest this.

#### ShipLoot

This mod is fairly outdated, and while we aren't certain it is causing issues - it's time to be replaced.

Makes the enemies vulnerable to mines. What more could you want?

Makes it so you can find shells and that you can buy them (for a prohibitive amount).

#### [FasterItemDropship](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FlipMods/FasterItemDropship/)

Enough with the slow dropship!

Removed NeedyCats due to causing game breaking bugs.

Removed ScalingStartCredits due to not working properly.

Removed BoomBoxNoPower due to not really making a noticable QOL difference and causing potential bugs in terms of whether we can hear it playing properly.

Removed HotbarPlus due to 1.4.5 being completely broken and the chance of it causing serious issues that MikesTweaks sounds like it'll fix.

Removed ReservedItemSlotCore, ReservedWalkieSlot, ReservedFlashlightSlot, & ReservedSprayPaintSlot we'll keep the 6 default slots from MikesTweaks and let those kind of replace the reserved slots.

Because I'm evil and want to be there when someone gets scared by this.

#### [JumpDelayPatch](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/monkes_mods/JumpDelayPatch/)

I have noticed a delay at times, so this will hopefully solve those.

#### [MoreScreams](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/egeadam/MoreScreams/)

Add this back (voice transmits just a little bit longer after death).

#### [BetterSprayPaint](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/taffyko/BetterSprayPaint/)

Fix the issues with spray paint.

#### [QuotaRollover](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/boxofbiscuits97/QuotaRollover/)

Removes the penalty for over conntributing to quota, making overrage rollover to the next quota. A QOL change.

#### [NoPenalty](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/bizzlemip/NoPenalty/)

Another QOL change, the death penalty normally is an issue when we mess around at the company building, and doesn't happen often when we're on industrial moons, so we've decide to nix the penalty.

#### [BoomBoxNoPower](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/TV23/BoomBoxNoPower/)

A QOL change? Yup. Boombox now immortal.

#### [ScalingStartCredits](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/sunnobunno/ScalingStartCredits/)

Adds a compass, useful for remembering where to go.

Boombox go brrr. But also can be loud. This lets your change the volume of various noise producing objects.

#### [ShipClock](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ATK/ShipClock/)

Why Zeekers decided the clock needs to go poof when you're in the ship I'll never understand. This solves that problem.
